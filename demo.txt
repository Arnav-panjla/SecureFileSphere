Signcryption is a public-key cryptographic primitive, originally introduced by
Zheng (Crypto â€™97), that allows parties to establish secure communication without the need
of prior key agreement. Instead, a party registers its public key at a certificate authority (CA),
and only needs to retrieve the public key of the intended partner from the CA before being
able to protect the communication. Signcryption schemes provide both authenticity and
confidentiality of sent messages and can offer a simpler interface to applications and better
performance compared to generic compositions of signature and encryption schemes.
Although introduced two decades ago, the question which security notions of signcryption are
adequate in which applications has still not reached a fully satisfactory answer. To resolve
this question, we conduct a constructive analysis of this public-key primitive. Similar to
previous constructive studies for other important primitives, this treatment allows to identify
the natural goal that signcryption schemes should achieve and to formalize this goal in a
composable framework. More specifically, we capture the goal of signcryption as a gracefully-
degrading secure network, which is basically a network of independent parties that allows
secure communication between any two parties. However, when a party is compromised, its
respective security guarantees are lost, while all guarantees for the remaining users remain
unaffected. We show which security notions for signcryption are sufficient to construct this
kind of secure network from a certificate authority (or key registration resource) and insecure
communication. Our study does not only unveil that it is the so-called insider-security notion
that enables this construction, but also that a weaker version thereof would already be
sufficient. This may be of interest in the context of practical signcryption schemes that do
not achieve the stronger notions
